   - anti_spawncamp (made it so you are invincible for 3 seconds on each spawn (anti-spawn camp))
     * when you spawn your weapon will flash 3 times indicating the 3 seconds of immortality
     * option in comp.ini to disable this feature (disable_asc)
     * admins have a command called toggle_asc to toggle this on/off
     * rcon/x users can just toggle the cvar from console
     * this can be set in the server.cfg as well

   - kick_flamehack (kick clients with hacked flames)
     * option in comp.ini to turn this feature on 
     * rcon/x users can just toggle the cvar from console
     * this can be set in the server.cfg as well
     * from now on you'll get kicked for using gl_polyblend set to 0 
       (because it removes the flame from screen). Some people use this only to get rid off
       those annoying flashes when you pick things up etc. All those people should use
       a new command "polyblend" which will remove these flashes but not flames.

 * improved the kick message when clients don't have mmclient.exe or have an old one 
   or have invalid models or old version of kingpin.exe (it shuts kingpin.exe down and a popup 
   window gives them the kick message and what to do about it)

=================================================

 * added new cvar (no_spec)
   - no_spec makes the screen black for non-admin/non-rconx spectators (basically
     stops them from seeing whats going on in the server). This is to stop voice 
     communication cheating by using programs such as Roger Wilco and BattleCom 
     to give away the players positions and details

   - admins can use disable_spec command to change it
   - note when this is enabled if people have gl_polyblend set to 0 they will
     get kicked for a flamehack because gl_polyblend set to 0 will remove the
     black spectator screen

 * removed kick_flamehack from comp.ini
   - now kick_flamehack can only be set in server.cfg or by a command

 * modified idle_client cvar
   - now it will only boot players to spectator mode if a match is in progress,
     not during pre-match, map voting or intermission time.

   - now admins should use toggle_spec instead of disable_spec

   - with banip and banname the ip address or the name of the client you wish to ban
     will be written to ip ban list file and name ban list file specified in comp.ini
   - bans take effect on next map change
   - please use these 2 commands cautiously as the process is only reversable manually
   - you can ban names with partial match so be careful what words or part of words you ban
   - also with banip you can also ban subnets (read ips.txt for more info)
     also be extremly careful with this too

 * chat fix
   - fixed a bug where rconx normal chat looked like team chat

   - now if a bagman map is loaded in team deathmatch mode there will be no safebags,
     no cash spawns and no cash dropping.
